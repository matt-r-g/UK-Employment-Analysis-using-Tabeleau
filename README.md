# UK Employment Data Analysis 📊💼

Welcome to the **UK Employment Data Analysis** project! In this project, I worked with a UK Employment dataset and performed data analysis using **Tableau**. The goal was to uncover insights and visualise the data in a clear, interactive and aesthetically pleasing way.

## 📈 Project Overview

This project analyses employment trends across the UK, including data on employment rates, job types and economic factors affecting the workforce. Using Tableau, I created several interactive visualisations to provide insights into the dataset, making the findings easier to interpret for decision-makers.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used

For this project, I utilised Tableau to create insightful and dynamic visualisations. The following techniques were employed:

- **Visualisations**: I created a range of visualisation types, such as bar charts, line graphs and maps, to display key trends and patterns.
- **Marks**: Used marks to represent data points visually, allowing for deeper exploration of specific data points.
- **Filters**: Applied filters to allow users to interact with the visualisations, adjusting the view based on specific criteria such as year, region, or job sector.
- **Calculated Fields**: Created custom calculations to derive new insights from the dataset, such as the percentage change in employment over time.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Combined multiple visualisations into cohesive dashboards that allow for dynamic exploration of the data.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Employment Rate Trends**: I visualised the overall employment rate in the UK over time, helping to identify periods of growth and decline.
- **Regional Employment**: A geographical visualisation shows how employment varies across different regions of the UK, highlighting regional disparities.
- **Job Sector Analysis**: I created a visualisation that breaks down employment by sector, providing insight into the UK's main employment areas.
- **Time-Based Insights**: Used time-based visualisations to display trends in employment and job creation across different years and months.

## 💡 Conclusion

This project allowed me to improve my Tableau skills and gain valuable insights into the UK employment landscape. By creating a variety of interactive visualisations, I was able to make the data more accessible and insightful for users, helping to uncover trends and patterns that would otherwise be difficult to interpret from raw data.

The ability to create dynamic and visually appealing dashboards is a powerful skill and this project helped me understand how to effectively communicate data-driven insights to a broader audience.
